# First Step

Make sure node.js is installed. If you don't have it, download the recommended version from here: https://nodejs.org/en. Then check if it is installed by opening command prompt and run the following command `node -v`

# Second Step

Change to the development branch. Make sure you are inside the folder Angular

# Third Step

Open the project, preferably in Intellij or an IDE from Jetbrains, and run in the terminal `npm install`. This will create a node_modules directory which has all the dependencies.

# Fourth Step

Now we can start the project. Run `ng serve` or in Intellij you should have on the top right `Angular CLI Server`, you can also run that. There should appear a link with the localhost. Press the link and the app should open in the browser.
