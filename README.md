# First Step

Make sure node.js is installed. If you don't have it, download the recommended version from here: https://nodejs.org/en. Then check if it is installed by opening command prompt and run the following command `node -v`

# Second Step

Change to the development branch. Make sure you are inside the folder Angular

# Third Step

Open the project, preferably in Intellij or an IDE from Jetbrains, and run in the terminal `npm install`. This will create a node_modules directory which has all the dependencies.

# Fourth Step

Now we can start the project. Run `ng serve` or in Intellij you should have on the top right `Angular CLI Server`, you can also run that. There should appear a link with the localhost. Press the link and the app should open in the browser.

The data won't be on GitLab because the folders containing the data have more than 100MB. They will be presented on the examination day. The data can be downloaded from src/assets from Github: https://github.com/bogda01/Angular_Bachelors_Project/tree/development
